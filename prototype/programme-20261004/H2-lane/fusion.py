"""H2-lane structural integration: REAL fusion + fission + quarantine.

Successor-003 (R1): fuse/fission pre-validate settleability of every
world they will dissolve BEFORE any host mutation (no partial effects
on rejection, extending the fission docstring promise to both ops);
kill-during-fusion/fission is a defined interruption boundary with
idempotent completion via recover.complete_fusion/complete_fission
(see INTERRUPTION-BOUNDARIES.md). Clean-path ledger bytes unchanged.

Fusion merges two cooperating worlds into one composite:
- recorded lineage (derived_from both parents, resolvable in-ledger),
- ownership transfer (every state class moves giver -> composite),
- lifecycle moves (parents settle-then-dissolve; composite activates),
- AND removal of a now-redundant mechanism: the direct channel between
  the fused pair (intra-composite coordination is internal afterwards).
A before/after mechanism inventory makes the removal checkable.

Fission splits a fused composite back into two worlds (reverse of
fusion with a partition record): custody back-transfer per the
partition, composite settle-then-dissolve, children activate, lineage
entries naming the fusion being split, and the direct channel between
the children restored (cross-boundary coordination is explicit again).

Quarantine stays the failure-driven separation path: a failed
participant is suspended with commitment transfer to a standby.
See SEPARATION-PATHS.md for when each path applies.
